"""Lightweight schema migrations.

``create_all`` creates missing tables but never alters existing ones, so a
database written by an older version would be missing the newer columns. This
module adds them in place.

The scope is deliberately narrow: adding columns and tables, which is all the
schema has needed so far and what every supported backend does safely. A
change that renames or drops a column would need a real migration tool.
